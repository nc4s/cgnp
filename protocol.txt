CGNP (Cruz General Network Protocol)

CGNP is designed to send messages from one user to another, as opposed to sending a message from a
server to a client and from a client to a server. This is called peer to peer (P2P).
This system has many advantages, such as:

 - faster connections (for one user to talk to another the message doesn't have to pass through
    a server first)
 - no central point of failure (in a client-server situation, if a server goes down, there is no
    connection whatsoever, but in a P2P configuration there is no central point that can fail)
 - scalability: in a client-server configuration the server has to handle all requests, so more
    users = worse performance, but with P2P the load is distributed across users
 - lower infrastructure costs
